# CAI Inference Service Articles

Collection of examples with recommendations for deploying models to Cloudera AI Inference Service.

### Deploy Llama 3.1 8B Instruct to AI Inference Service from HF Catalog Programmatically

In this tutorial you will learn how to programmatically deploy Meta's Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct LLM to the Cloudera AI Inference Service. First, you will download the model to the Cloudera AI Registry; Then, you will create an AI Inference Service Endpoint to serve predictions in real time from within your Data Center.

If you'd like to use a different model you can apply the same steps for any language models available in the Hugging Face Catalog.

### LLMOps Utils for Cloudera AI Inference Service

In this tutorial you will learn how to deploy Deepseek R1 Distill Llama 8B to the Cloudera AI Inference Service programmatically using Python and an LLMOps Util.

First, you will download the model to the Cloudera AI Registry; Then, you will create an AI Inference Service Endpoint to serve predictions in real time from within your Data Center.

The LLMOps util and the overall tutorial is particularly tailored for CAI users who want to complete the end to end lifecycle - from LLM download to Endpoint - entirely in Python. If you'd like to use a different model you can apply the same steps for any language models available in the NGC Catalog.

### Train, Register, Deploy and Serve XGBoost Classifier to AI Inference Service Programmatically

In this tutorial you will learn how to build an XGBoost classifier and deploy it to the Cloudera AI Inference Service. First, you will train and register the model with the Cloudera AI Registry; Then, you will create an AI Inference Service Endpoint to serve predictions in real time from your secure endpoint.
